Reimplement Thud player
* C++(11?) because of abstraction limitations in C
* use game state representation amenable to machine learning (cf Giraffe)
* decouple UI from computer player
* decouple each side's computer players from each other
* allow "pondering" - thinking on opponent's turn
* use same code for interactive play, self play learning, subprocess
* proper up-front testing (tdd, quickcheck-type properties, more?)
* proper on-disk format for storing game data
* cmake because cmake

non-goals
* do everything at once

rough task order (TEST ALL THE THINGS)
* game state representation
* bulk move generation
* incremental move generation (boost coroutine2?)
* do move
* undo move
* minimal evaluator
* mcts (do this first? less understood, more interesting)
* some kind of game tree debugging tool thingy
* UI of some sort
* naive minimax
* iterative deepening
* zobrist hashing
* ttable
* game data serialization format
* move ordering
* alpha-beta pruning
* search extension for sacrifice moves
* mtd(f)
